Here we go!</strong></p> <p>Before we discuss this new option, let&#8217;s quickly recap what we had suggested regarding exiting ULIPs.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong>The Old ULIP Playbook: What We Knew Before</strong></strong></h2> <p>Three fundamental ways to exit a ULIP:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Discontinue during the lock-in period:</mark></strong> This is a painful option. You stop paying premiums, but your money gets locked in a &#8220;Discontinuance Fund&#8221; earning a measly ~3.5% interest after charges. You also pay a discontinuance fee and lose your life cover immediately. At the end of the 5-year lock-in, you might get back only 60-70% of what you paid. On top of that, there can be nasty tax implications, reversing your Section 80C benefits.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Surrender after the lock-in period:</mark></strong> This is cleaner. Once the mandatory 5 years are over, you can surrender the policy, get your fund&#8217;s value back with no charges, and the amount is tax-free if your annual premium was under ₹2.5 lakhs. The downside? You have to wait it out, leaving your money stuck in a sub-par product.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Convert to a Paid-up Policy:</mark></strong> We called this the &#8220;worst&#8221; option. After 5 years, you can stop paying premiums, but a reduced sum assured remains. Your money stays locked in the ULIP, and the insurer continues to charge you fees, eroding your potential returns.</li> </ol> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9a1d805a423c711a2e635754c670f1d8" style="font-size:1.2rem"><strong><strong><strong>Our earlier verdict on ULIP exist was simple:</strong></strong></strong></h3> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you&#8217;ve paid premiums for only 1-2 years:</mark> </strong>Bite the bullet and discontinue immediately. Take the financial hit, consider it a lesson fee, and redirect your future cash flows to a pure term insurance and a low-cost index fund.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you&#8217;ve paid premiums for 3 or 4 years:</mark> </strong>The tax hit from reversing 80C deductions is too significant. It&#8217;s often better to wait out the remaining lock-in period and then surrender the policy.</li> </ul> <p>Now, here&#8217;s the problem with our earlier recommendations.</p> <p>If you discontinued during the lock-in period, your money would be stuck earning a measly 3.5% until the lock-in ended. That&#8217;s worse than most savings accounts!</p> <p>And if you decided to wait till the lock-in ended, you&#8217;d have to keep paying premiums for a policy you didn&#8217;t even want. That&#8217;s like continuing to water a dead plant just because you can&#8217;t remove it from your balcony for 5 years.</p> <p>Not ideal, right?</p> <p>What if we told you there is a way to escape the lock-in, get your money now, and here is the kicker, keep your insurance cover active for free?</p> <p>Enter: The Policy Assignment.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>What Is Policy Assignment?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>In simple terms, assignment is the legal transfer of your policy&#8217;s ownership and benefits to another person or entity.</p> <p>A provision called Section 38 of the Insurance Act, 1938, allows a policyholder to transfer (or &#8220;assign&#8221;) their rights in an insurance policy to someone else.</p> <p>There are two main types:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Absolute Assignment:</mark></strong> This is a permanent transfer, usually for money. You are selling all your rights in the policy to the new owner. </li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Collateral Assignment:</mark></strong> This is a temporary transfer, often used as security for a loan (like taking a loan from a bank against your policy). Once the loan is repaid, the policy is transferred back to you.</li> </ol> <p>And recently, we came across a platform called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thepolicyexchange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Policy Exchange</strong></a>. They are essentially building a bridge between people who want to get rid of their policies (you) and investors who want stable returns.</p> <p>They facilitate Absolute Assignment, where you are selling the policy outright.</p> <p>Think of it like selling a second-hand car. You bought it, you don&#8217;t want it anymore, so you transfer the ownership papers to a buyer. The buyer pays you cash, and they take the car.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>How Does The Policy Exchange Platform Work?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Approach the Platform:</mark></strong> You tell The Policy Exchange that you wish to assign your ULIP policy.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">They Value Your Policy:</mark></strong> The platform calculates an approximate value for your policy. This is typically close to the &#8220;surrender value&#8221; you would get from the insurer, but since you&#8217;re selling it before the lock-in ends, it&#8217;s a discounted amount.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Your Policy is Listed:</mark></strong> The policy is listed on their platform for investors to browse. These investors are looking for assets that can give them returns in the 8-12% range.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">An Investor Buys It:</mark></strong> An investor agrees to buy your policy. They pay you the agreed-upon discounted surrender value amount upfront.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">The Transfer is Executed:</mark></strong> The policy is legally assigned to the investor. From this point on, they become the new owners. They are responsible for paying any future premiums (if applicable), and they are entitled to receive the maturity value when the policy matures.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Get Your Money &amp; Retain Partial Cover:</mark></strong> You walk away with a lump sum of cash immediately. And crucially, your life cover doesn&#8217;t completely vanish.</li> </ol> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-d0f2a008fc5be13c0b2eb535a3c2fe28" style="font-size:1.2rem"><strong><strong><strong>Wait, How Do I Still Have Life Cover After Selling My Policy?</strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>This is the interesting part of this arrangement offered by The Policy Exchange. Let&#8217;s break it down with an example.</p> <p>Suppose you sell a policy with a Sum Assured (life cover) of ₹10 Lakhs to an investor for ₹2 Lakhs.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>The investor now owns the policy and is entitled to the maturity benefit.</li> <li>However, if, God forbid, you were to pass away before the policy matures or is surrendered, the insurance company pays out the ₹10 Lakh death claim.</li> <li>This ₹10 Lakh is not given entirely to the investor. The investor is legally entitled to get back their initial investment (₹2 Lakhs) plus the committed return (say, 10%). That comes to ₹2.2 Lakhs.</li> <li>The remaining amount (₹10 Lakhs &#8211; ₹2.2 Lakhs = ₹7.8 Lakhs) is paid to your family/nominee.</li> </ul> <p>So, by selling your ULIP policy, you:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Get immediate liquidity (discounted surrender value).</li> <li>Retain a significant portion of your life cover for your family, which you would have completely lost if you had simply discontinued the policy.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Benefits of Selling Your ULIPs</strong></strong></strong></h2> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Escape the Lock-in Period:</mark></strong> This is the biggest advantage. You don&#8217;t have to wait till the lock-in period ends to access your money. You get a lump sum upfront, which you can then use to buy a proper <a href="https://blog.vrid.in/2022/10/27/why-life-insurance-which-is-the-best-plan-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>term plan</strong></a> and invest in better avenues.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Avoid Financial Bleeding:</mark> </strong>Compared to discontinuing, you will likely get a better financial deal. Instead of your money rotting in a discontinuance fund for years, you get most of its current value in your hand now.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Retain Partial Life Cover:</mark></strong> You don&#8217;t leave your family financially vulnerable. A major part of your life insurance safety net remains active.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Better Than Paid-Up:</mark></strong> Unlike making the policy paid-up, here you actually get cash in hand.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">A Clean Exit:</mark></strong> It severs your relationship with a product you don&#8217;t want, without the guilt of &#8220;wasting&#8221; the insurance you already paid for.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Risks of Selling Your ULIPs</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>No solution is perfect. Here&#8217;s what you should consider:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Won&#8217;t Get 100% Value:</mark></strong> The investor is buying your policy at a discount to its surrender value, allowing them to make a profit.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Not All Policies May Find Buyers:</mark></strong> Depending on the terms of your ULIP, remaining tenure, and market conditions, your policy may or may not find interested buyers quickly. Some policies might be more attractive to investors than others.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Platform Dependency:</mark></strong> You are relying on the platform&#8217;s due diligence and operational efficiency. While the payouts are handled by the insurance company, any platform-side hiccups could cause delays, especially in death claims.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">It&#8217;s a relatively new model:</mark></strong> As a new FinTech platform, it doesn&#8217;t fall under any specific regulator. IRDAI regulates the underlying insurance policy, and the assignment process is legal, but the platform itself operates in a newer, less-established space. Future regulatory changes could affect how these transactions work.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Taxes:</mark></strong> The tax implication of selling a policy is a bit of a grey area compared to standard surrender. If you surrender after 5 years, the proceeds are usually tax-free (if premium &lt; ₹2.5 Lakhs). If you sell, you are receiving money from a third party. While it mimics a surrender, you should consult a CA to ensure you don&#8217;t get hit with an unexpected tax demand.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>When Should You Think About Selling Your ULIP?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>So, should you sell, surrender, or discontinue? Let&#8217;s update our decision matrix.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you are still in the lock-in period (and have paid 1-4 premiums):</mark></strong> Selling/Assigning your policy via a platform like The Policy Exchange is likely your best option, assuming the discount on the surrender value is not too high. It helps you exit early with cash in hand while preserving a critical part of your life insurance. It&#8217;s far superior to discontinuing and waiting painfully for the lock-in to end.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If your policy has completed the lock-in period:</mark></strong> Surrendering the policy directly to the insurance company is probably better. At this stage, you can get the full fund value without any charges, and the amount is often tax-free. The hassle of selling might not be worth it since you can exit cleanly on your own.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>The journey of personal finance is about learning and adapting. Making a mistake by investing in a ULIP is not the end of the world. The key is to find the most efficient exit door.</p> <p>The emergence of platforms like The Policy Exchange has created a valuable new exit door for those trapped in the 5-year lock-in. It turns a stagnant, underperforming asset into liquid capital and salvages your life cover, a win-win that wasn&#8217;t easily available before.</p> <p>Before you make any decision, always read the fine print. Check the specific terms of your ULIP policy and understand the exact offer from any platform you use. But for the first time, if you&#8217;re stuck in a ULIP you regret, you have a powerful new tool to break free.</p> <p>Share these insights with your buddies.</p> <ul class="wp-block-social-links

There&#8217;s now a brand-new alternative that could be a game-changer, especially if you&#8217;re stuck in the dreaded 5-year lock-in period.</p> <p>You can now sell (assign) your ULIP policy to someone else.</p> <p>Sounds interesting?

Here we go!</strong></p> <p>Before we discuss this new option, let&#8217;s quickly recap what we had suggested regarding exiting ULIPs.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong>The Old ULIP Playbook: What We Knew Before</strong></strong></h2> <p>Three fundamental ways to exit a ULIP:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Discontinue during the lock-in period:</mark></strong> This is a painful option. You stop paying premiums, but your money gets locked in a &#8220;Discontinuance Fund&#8221; earning a measly ~3.5% interest after charges. You also pay a discontinuance fee and lose your life cover immediately. At the end of the 5-year lock-in, you might get back only 60-70% of what you paid. On top of that, there can be nasty tax implications, reversing your Section 80C benefits.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Surrender after the lock-in period:</mark></strong> This is cleaner. Once the mandatory 5 years are over, you can surrender the policy, get your fund&#8217;s value back with no charges, and the amount is tax-free if your annual premium was under ₹2.5 lakhs. The downside? You have to wait it out, leaving your money stuck in a sub-par product.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Convert to a Paid-up Policy:</mark></strong> We called this the &#8220;worst&#8221; option. After 5 years, you can stop paying premiums, but a reduced sum assured remains. Your money stays locked in the ULIP, and the insurer continues to charge you fees, eroding your potential returns.</li> </ol> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9a1d805a423c711a2e635754c670f1d8" style="font-size:1.2rem"><strong><strong><strong>Our earlier verdict on ULIP exist was simple:</strong></strong></strong></h3> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you&#8217;ve paid premiums for only 1-2 years:</mark> </strong>Bite the bullet and discontinue immediately. Take the financial hit, consider it a lesson fee, and redirect your future cash flows to a pure term insurance and a low-cost index fund.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you&#8217;ve paid premiums for 3 or 4 years:</mark> </strong>The tax hit from reversing 80C deductions is too significant. It&#8217;s often better to wait out the remaining lock-in period and then surrender the policy.</li> </ul> <p>Now, here&#8217;s the problem with our earlier recommendations.</p> <p>If you discontinued during the lock-in period, your money would be stuck earning a measly 3.5% until the lock-in ended. That&#8217;s worse than most savings accounts!</p> <p>And if you decided to wait till the lock-in ended, you&#8217;d have to keep paying premiums for a policy you didn&#8217;t even want. That&#8217;s like continuing to water a dead plant just because you can&#8217;t remove it from your balcony for 5 years.</p> <p>Not ideal, right?</p> <p>What if we told you there is a way to escape the lock-in, get your money now, and here is the kicker, keep your insurance cover active for free?</p> <p>Enter: The Policy Assignment.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>What Is Policy Assignment?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>In simple terms, assignment is the legal transfer of your policy&#8217;s ownership and benefits to another person or entity.</p> <p>A provision called Section 38 of the Insurance Act, 1938, allows a policyholder to transfer (or &#8220;assign&#8221;) their rights in an insurance policy to someone else.</p> <p>There are two main types:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Absolute Assignment:</mark></strong> This is a permanent transfer, usually for money. You are selling all your rights in the policy to the new owner. </li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Collateral Assignment:</mark></strong> This is a temporary transfer, often used as security for a loan (like taking a loan from a bank against your policy). Once the loan is repaid, the policy is transferred back to you.</li> </ol> <p>And recently, we came across a platform called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thepolicyexchange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Policy Exchange</strong></a>. They are essentially building a bridge between people who want to get rid of their policies (you) and investors who want stable returns.</p> <p>They facilitate Absolute Assignment, where you are selling the policy outright.</p> <p>Think of it like selling a second-hand car. You bought it, you don&#8217;t want it anymore, so you transfer the ownership papers to a buyer. The buyer pays you cash, and they take the car.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>How Does The Policy Exchange Platform Work?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Approach the Platform:</mark></strong> You tell The Policy Exchange that you wish to assign your ULIP policy.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">They Value Your Policy:</mark></strong> The platform calculates an approximate value for your policy. This is typically close to the &#8220;surrender value&#8221; you would get from the insurer, but since you&#8217;re selling it before the lock-in ends, it&#8217;s a discounted amount.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Your Policy is Listed:</mark></strong> The policy is listed on their platform for investors to browse. These investors are looking for assets that can give them returns in the 8-12% range.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">An Investor Buys It:</mark></strong> An investor agrees to buy your policy.

Let&#8217;s break it down with an example.</p> <p>Suppose you sell a policy with a Sum Assured (life cover) of ₹10 Lakhs to an investor for ₹2 Lakhs.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>The investor now owns the policy and is entitled to the maturity benefit.</li> <li>However, if, God forbid, you were to pass away before the policy matures or is surrendered, the insurance company pays out the ₹10 Lakh death claim.</li> <li>This ₹10 Lakh is not given entirely to the investor. The investor is legally entitled to get back their initial investment (₹2 Lakhs) plus the committed return (say, 10%). That comes to ₹2.2 Lakhs.</li> <li>The remaining amount (₹10 Lakhs &#8211; ₹2.2 Lakhs = ₹7.8 Lakhs) is paid to your family/nominee.</li> </ul> <p>So, by selling your ULIP policy, you:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Get immediate liquidity (discounted surrender value).</li> <li>Retain a significant portion of your life cover for your family, which you would have completely lost if you had simply discontinued the policy.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Benefits of Selling Your ULIPs</strong></strong></strong></h2> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Escape the Lock-in Period:</mark></strong> This is the biggest advantage. You don&#8217;t have to wait till the lock-in period ends to access your money. You get a lump sum upfront, which you can then use to buy a proper <a href="https://blog.vrid.in/2022/10/27/why-life-insurance-which-is-the-best-plan-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>term plan</strong></a> and invest in better avenues.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Avoid Financial Bleeding:</mark> </strong>Compared to discontinuing, you will likely get a better financial deal. Instead of your money rotting in a discontinuance fund for years, you get most of its current value in your hand now.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Retain Partial Life Cover:</mark></strong> You don&#8217;t leave your family financially vulnerable. A major part of your life insurance safety net remains active.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Better Than Paid-Up:</mark></strong> Unlike making the policy paid-up, here you actually get cash in hand.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">A Clean Exit:</mark></strong> It severs your relationship with a product you don&#8217;t want, without the guilt of &#8220;wasting&#8221; the insurance you already paid for.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Risks of Selling Your ULIPs</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>No solution is perfect. Here&#8217;s what you should consider:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Won&#8217;t Get 100% Value:</mark></strong> The investor is buying your policy at a discount to its surrender value, allowing them to make a profit.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Not All Policies May Find Buyers:</mark></strong> Depending on the terms of your ULIP, remaining tenure, and market conditions, your policy may or may not find interested buyers quickly. Some policies might be more attractive to investors than others.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Platform Dependency:</mark></strong> You are relying on the platform&#8217;s due diligence and operational efficiency. While the payouts are handled by the insurance company, any platform-side hiccups could cause delays, especially in death claims.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">It&#8217;s a relatively new model:</mark></strong> As a new FinTech platform, it doesn&#8217;t fall under any specific regulator. IRDAI regulates the underlying insurance policy, and the assignment process is legal, but the platform itself operates in a newer, less-established space. Future regulatory changes could affect how these transactions work.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Taxes:</mark></strong> The tax implication of selling a policy is a bit of a grey area compared to standard surrender. If you surrender after 5 years, the proceeds are usually tax-free (if premium &lt; ₹2.5 Lakhs). If you sell, you are receiving money from a third party. While it mimics a surrender, you should consult a CA to ensure you don&#8217;t get hit with an unexpected tax demand.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>When Should You Think About Selling Your ULIP?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>So, should you sell, surrender, or discontinue? Let&#8217;s update our decision matrix.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you are still in the lock-in period (and have paid 1-4 premiums):</mark></strong> Selling/Assigning your policy via a platform like The Policy Exchange is likely your best option, assuming the discount on the surrender value is not too high. It helps you exit early with cash in hand while preserving a critical part of your life insurance. It&#8217;s far superior to discontinuing and waiting painfully for the lock-in to end.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If your policy has completed the lock-in period:</mark></strong> Surrendering the policy directly to the insurance company is probably better. At this stage, you can get the full fund value without any charges, and the amount is often tax-free. The hassle of selling might not be worth it since you can exit cleanly on your own.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>The journey of personal finance is about learning and adapting. Making a mistake by investing in a ULIP is not the end of the world. The key is to find the most efficient exit door.</p> <p>The emergence of platforms like The Policy Exchange has created a valuable new exit door for those trapped in the 5-year lock-in. It turns a stagnant, underperforming asset into liquid capital and salvages your life cover, a win-win that wasn&#8217;t easily available before.</p> <p>Before you make any decision, always read the fine print. Check the specific terms of your ULIP policy and understand the exact offer from any platform you use. But for the first time, if you&#8217;re stuck in a ULIP you regret, you have a powerful new tool to break free.</p> <p>Share these insights with your buddies.</p> <ul class="wp-block-social-links

There&#8217;s now a brand-new alternative that could be a game-changer, especially if you&#8217;re stuck in the dreaded 5-year lock-in period.</p> <p>You can now sell (assign) your ULIP policy to someone else.</p> <p>Sounds interesting?

Here we go!</strong></p> <p>Before we discuss this new option, let&#8217;s quickly recap what we had suggested regarding exiting ULIPs.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong>The Old ULIP Playbook: What We Knew Before</strong></strong></h2> <p>Three fundamental ways to exit a ULIP:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Discontinue during the lock-in period:</mark></strong> This is a painful option. You stop paying premiums, but your money gets locked in a &#8220;Discontinuance Fund&#8221; earning a measly ~3.5% interest after charges. You also pay a discontinuance fee and lose your life cover immediately. At the end of the 5-year lock-in, you might get back only 60-70% of what you paid. On top of that, there can be nasty tax implications, reversing your Section 80C benefits.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Surrender after the lock-in period:</mark></strong> This is cleaner. Once the mandatory 5 years are over, you can surrender the policy, get your fund&#8217;s value back with no charges, and the amount is tax-free if your annual premium was under ₹2.5 lakhs. The downside? You have to wait it out, leaving your money stuck in a sub-par product.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Convert to a Paid-up Policy:</mark></strong> We called this the &#8220;worst&#8221; option. After 5 years, you can stop paying premiums, but a reduced sum assured remains. Your money stays locked in the ULIP, and the insurer continues to charge you fees, eroding your potential returns.</li> </ol> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9a1d805a423c711a2e635754c670f1d8" style="font-size:1.2rem"><strong><strong><strong>Our earlier verdict on ULIP exist was simple:</strong></strong></strong></h3> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you&#8217;ve paid premiums for only 1-2 years:</mark> </strong>Bite the bullet and discontinue immediately. Take the financial hit, consider it a lesson fee, and redirect your future cash flows to a pure term insurance and a low-cost index fund.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you&#8217;ve paid premiums for 3 or 4 years:</mark> </strong>The tax hit from reversing 80C deductions is too significant. It&#8217;s often better to wait out the remaining lock-in period and then surrender the policy.</li> </ul> <p>Now, here&#8217;s the problem with our earlier recommendations.</p> <p>If you discontinued during the lock-in period, your money would be stuck earning a measly 3.5% until the lock-in ended. That&#8217;s worse than most savings accounts!</p> <p>And if you decided to wait till the lock-in ended, you&#8217;d have to keep paying premiums for a policy you didn&#8217;t even want. That&#8217;s like continuing to water a dead plant just because you can&#8217;t remove it from your balcony for 5 years.</p> <p>Not ideal, right?</p> <p>What if we told you there is a way to escape the lock-in, get your money now, and here is the kicker, keep your insurance cover active for free?</p> <p>Enter: The Policy Assignment.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>What Is Policy Assignment?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>In simple terms, assignment is the legal transfer of your policy&#8217;s ownership and benefits to another person or entity.</p> <p>A provision called Section 38 of the Insurance Act, 1938, allows a policyholder to transfer (or &#8220;assign&#8221;) their rights in an insurance policy to someone else.</p> <p>There are two main types:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Absolute Assignment:</mark></strong> This is a permanent transfer, usually for money. You are selling all your rights in the policy to the new owner. </li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Collateral Assignment:</mark></strong> This is a temporary transfer, often used as security for a loan (like taking a loan from a bank against your policy). Once the loan is repaid, the policy is transferred back to you.</li> </ol> <p>And recently, we came across a platform called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thepolicyexchange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Policy Exchange</strong></a>. They are essentially building a bridge between people who want to get rid of their policies (you) and investors who want stable returns.</p> <p>They facilitate Absolute Assignment, where you are selling the policy outright.</p> <p>Think of it like selling a second-hand car. You bought it, you don&#8217;t want it anymore, so you transfer the ownership papers to a buyer. The buyer pays you cash, and they take the car.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>How Does The Policy Exchange Platform Work?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Approach the Platform:</mark></strong> You tell The Policy Exchange that you wish to assign your ULIP policy.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">They Value Your Policy:</mark></strong> The platform calculates an approximate value for your policy. This is typically close to the &#8220;surrender value&#8221; you would get from the insurer, but since you&#8217;re selling it before the lock-in ends, it&#8217;s a discounted amount.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Your Policy is Listed:</mark></strong> The policy is listed on their platform for investors to browse. These investors are looking for assets that can give them returns in the 8-12% range.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">An Investor Buys It:</mark></strong> An investor agrees to buy your policy. They pay you the agreed-upon discounted surrender value amount upfront.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">The Transfer is Executed:</mark></strong> The policy is legally assigned to the investor. From this point on, they become the new owners. They are responsible for paying any future premiums (if applicable), and they are entitled to receive the maturity value when the policy matures.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Get Your Money &amp; Retain Partial Cover:</mark></strong> You walk away with a lump sum of cash immediately. And crucially, your life cover doesn&#8217;t completely vanish.</li> </ol> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-d0f2a008fc5be13c0b2eb535a3c2fe28" style="font-size:1.2rem"><strong><strong><strong>Wait, How Do I Still Have Life Cover After Selling My Policy?</strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>This is the interesting part of this arrangement offered by The Policy Exchange. Let&#8217;s break it down with an example.</p> <p>Suppose you sell a policy with a Sum Assured (life cover) of ₹10 Lakhs to an investor for ₹2 Lakhs.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>The investor now owns the policy and is entitled to the maturity benefit.</li> <li>However, if, God forbid, you were to pass away before the policy matures or is surrendered, the insurance company pays out the ₹10 Lakh death claim.</li> <li>This ₹10 Lakh is not given entirely to the investor. The investor is legally entitled to get back their initial investment (₹2 Lakhs) plus the committed return (say, 10%). That comes to ₹2.2 Lakhs.</li> <li>The remaining amount (₹10 Lakhs &#8211; ₹2.2 Lakhs = ₹7.8 Lakhs) is paid to your family/nominee.</li> </ul> <p>So, by selling your ULIP policy, you:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Get immediate liquidity (discounted surrender value).</li> <li>Retain a significant portion of your life cover for your family, which you would have completely lost if you had simply discontinued the policy.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Benefits of Selling Your ULIPs</strong></strong></strong></h2> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Escape the Lock-in Period:</mark></strong> This is the biggest advantage. You don&#8217;t have to wait till the lock-in period ends to access your money. You get a lump sum upfront, which you can then use to buy a proper <a href="https://blog.vrid.in/2022/10/27/why-life-insurance-which-is-the-best-plan-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>term plan</strong></a> and invest in better avenues.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Avoid Financial Bleeding:</mark> </strong>Compared to discontinuing, you will likely get a better financial deal. Instead of your money rotting in a discontinuance fund for years, you get most of its current value in your hand now.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Retain Partial Life Cover:</mark></strong> You don&#8217;t leave your family financially vulnerable. A major part of your life insurance safety net remains active.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Better Than Paid-Up:</mark></strong> Unlike making the policy paid-up, here you actually get cash in hand.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">A Clean Exit:</mark></strong> It severs your relationship with a product you don&#8217;t want, without the guilt of &#8220;wasting&#8221; the insurance you already paid for.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Risks of Selling Your ULIPs</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>No solution is perfect. Here&#8217;s what you should consider:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Won&#8217;t Get 100% Value:</mark></strong> The investor is buying your policy at a discount to its surrender value, allowing them to make a profit.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Not All Policies May Find Buyers:</mark></strong> Depending on the terms of your ULIP, remaining tenure, and market conditions, your policy may or may not find interested buyers quickly. Some policies might be more attractive to investors than others.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Platform Dependency:</mark></strong> You are relying on the platform&#8217;s due diligence and operational efficiency. While the payouts are handled by the insurance company, any platform-side hiccups could cause delays, especially in death claims.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">It&#8217;s a relatively new model:</mark></strong> As a new FinTech platform, it doesn&#8217;t fall under any specific regulator. IRDAI regulates the underlying insurance policy, and the assignment process is legal, but the platform itself operates in a newer, less-established space. Future regulatory changes could affect how these transactions work.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Taxes:</mark></strong> The tax implication of selling a policy is a bit of a grey area compared to standard surrender. If you surrender after 5 years, the proceeds are usually tax-free (if premium &lt; ₹2.5 Lakhs). If you sell, you are receiving money from a third party. While it mimics a surrender, you should consult a CA to ensure you don&#8217;t get hit with an unexpected tax demand.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>When Should You Think About Selling Your ULIP?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>So, should you sell, surrender, or discontinue? Let&#8217;s update our decision matrix.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you are still in the lock-in period (and have paid 1-4 premiums):</mark></strong> Selling/Assigning your policy via a platform like The Policy Exchange is likely your best option, assuming the discount on the surrender value is not too high. It helps you exit early with cash in hand while preserving a critical part of your life insurance. It&#8217;s far superior to discontinuing and waiting painfully for the lock-in to end.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If your policy has completed the lock-in period:</mark></strong> Surrendering the policy directly to the insurance company is probably better. At this stage, you can get the full fund value without any charges, and the amount is often tax-free. The hassle of selling might not be worth it since you can exit cleanly on your own.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>The journey of personal finance is about learning and adapting. Making a mistake by investing in a ULIP is not the end of the world. The key is to find the most efficient exit door.</p> <p>The emergence of platforms like The Policy Exchange has created a valuable new exit door for those trapped in the 5-year lock-in. It turns a stagnant, underperforming asset into liquid capital and salvages your life cover, a win-win that wasn&#8217;t easily available before.</p> <p>Before you make any decision, always read the fine print. Check the specific terms of your ULIP policy and understand the exact offer from any platform you use. But for the first time, if you&#8217;re stuck in a ULIP you regret, you have a powerful new tool to break free.</p> <p>Share these insights with your buddies.</p> <ul class="wp-block-social-links

There&#8217;s now a brand-new alternative that could be a game-changer, especially if you&#8217;re stuck in the dreaded 5-year lock-in period.</p> <p>You can now sell (assign) your ULIP policy to someone else.</p> <p>Sounds interesting?

Here we go!</strong></p> <p>Before we discuss this new option, let&#8217;s quickly recap what we had suggested regarding exiting ULIPs.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong>The Old ULIP Playbook: What We Knew Before</strong></strong></h2> <p>Three fundamental ways to exit a ULIP:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Discontinue during the lock-in period:</mark></strong> This is a painful option. You stop paying premiums, but your money gets locked in a &#8220;Discontinuance Fund&#8221; earning a measly ~3.5% interest after charges. You also pay a discontinuance fee and lose your life cover immediately. At the end of the 5-year lock-in, you might get back only 60-70% of what you paid. On top of that, there can be nasty tax implications, reversing your Section 80C benefits.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Surrender after the lock-in period:</mark></strong> This is cleaner. Once the mandatory 5 years are over, you can surrender the policy, get your fund&#8217;s value back with no charges, and the amount is tax-free if your annual premium was under ₹2.5 lakhs. The downside? You have to wait it out, leaving your money stuck in a sub-par product.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Convert to a Paid-up Policy:</mark></strong> We called this the &#8220;worst&#8221; option. After 5 years, you can stop paying premiums, but a reduced sum assured remains. Your money stays locked in the ULIP, and the insurer continues to charge you fees, eroding your potential returns.</li> </ol> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9a1d805a423c711a2e635754c670f1d8" style="font-size:1.2rem"><strong><strong><strong>Our earlier verdict on ULIP exist was simple:</strong></strong></strong></h3> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you&#8217;ve paid premiums for only 1-2 years:</mark> </strong>Bite the bullet and discontinue immediately. Take the financial hit, consider it a lesson fee, and redirect your future cash flows to a pure term insurance and a low-cost index fund.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you&#8217;ve paid premiums for 3 or 4 years:</mark> </strong>The tax hit from reversing 80C deductions is too significant. It&#8217;s often better to wait out the remaining lock-in period and then surrender the policy.</li> </ul> <p>Now, here&#8217;s the problem with our earlier recommendations.</p> <p>If you discontinued during the lock-in period, your money would be stuck earning a measly 3.5% until the lock-in ended. That&#8217;s worse than most savings accounts!</p> <p>And if you decided to wait till the lock-in ended, you&#8217;d have to keep paying premiums for a policy you didn&#8217;t even want. That&#8217;s like continuing to water a dead plant just because you can&#8217;t remove it from your balcony for 5 years.</p> <p>Not ideal, right?</p> <p>What if we told you there is a way to escape the lock-in, get your money now, and here is the kicker, keep your insurance cover active for free?</p> <p>Enter: The Policy Assignment.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>What Is Policy Assignment?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>In simple terms, assignment is the legal transfer of your policy&#8217;s ownership and benefits to another person or entity.</p> <p>A provision called Section 38 of the Insurance Act, 1938, allows a policyholder to transfer (or &#8220;assign&#8221;) their rights in an insurance policy to someone else.</p> <p>There are two main types:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Absolute Assignment:</mark></strong> This is a permanent transfer, usually for money. You are selling all your rights in the policy to the new owner. </li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Collateral Assignment:</mark></strong> This is a temporary transfer, often used as security for a loan (like taking a loan from a bank against your policy). Once the loan is repaid, the policy is transferred back to you.</li> </ol> <p>And recently, we came across a platform called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thepolicyexchange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Policy Exchange</strong></a>. They are essentially building a bridge between people who want to get rid of their policies (you) and investors who want stable returns.</p> <p>They facilitate Absolute Assignment, where you are selling the policy outright.</p> <p>Think of it like selling a second-hand car. You bought it, you don&#8217;t want it anymore, so you transfer the ownership papers to a buyer. The buyer pays you cash, and they take the car.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>How Does The Policy Exchange Platform Work?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Approach the Platform:</mark></strong> You tell The Policy Exchange that you wish to assign your ULIP policy.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">They Value Your Policy:</mark></strong> The platform calculates an approximate value for your policy. This is typically close to the &#8220;surrender value&#8221; you would get from the insurer, but since you&#8217;re selling it before the lock-in ends, it&#8217;s a discounted amount.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Your Policy is Listed:</mark></strong> The policy is listed on their platform for investors to browse. These investors are looking for assets that can give them returns in the 8-12% range.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">An Investor Buys It:</mark></strong> An investor agrees to buy your policy. They pay you the agreed-upon discounted surrender value amount upfront.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">The Transfer is Executed:</mark></strong> The policy is legally assigned to the investor. From this point on, they become the new owners. They are responsible for paying any future premiums (if applicable), and they are entitled to receive the maturity value when the policy matures.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Get Your Money &amp; Retain Partial Cover:</mark></strong> You walk away with a lump sum of cash immediately.

Let&#8217;s break it down with an example.</p> <p>Suppose you sell a policy with a Sum Assured (life cover) of ₹10 Lakhs to an investor for ₹2 Lakhs.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>The investor now owns the policy and is entitled to the maturity benefit.</li> <li>However, if, God forbid, you were to pass away before the policy matures or is surrendered, the insurance company pays out the ₹10 Lakh death claim.</li> <li>This ₹10 Lakh is not given entirely to the investor. The investor is legally entitled to get back their initial investment (₹2 Lakhs) plus the committed return (say, 10%). That comes to ₹2.2 Lakhs.</li> <li>The remaining amount (₹10 Lakhs &#8211; ₹2.2 Lakhs = ₹7.8 Lakhs) is paid to your family/nominee.</li> </ul> <p>So, by selling your ULIP policy, you:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Get immediate liquidity (discounted surrender value).</li> <li>Retain a significant portion of your life cover for your family, which you would have completely lost if you had simply discontinued the policy.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Benefits of Selling Your ULIPs</strong></strong></strong></h2> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Escape the Lock-in Period:</mark></strong> This is the biggest advantage. You don&#8217;t have to wait till the lock-in period ends to access your money. You get a lump sum upfront, which you can then use to buy a proper <a href="https://blog.vrid.in/2022/10/27/why-life-insurance-which-is-the-best-plan-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>term plan</strong></a> and invest in better avenues.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Avoid Financial Bleeding:</mark> </strong>Compared to discontinuing, you will likely get a better financial deal. Instead of your money rotting in a discontinuance fund for years, you get most of its current value in your hand now.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Retain Partial Life Cover:</mark></strong> You don&#8217;t leave your family financially vulnerable. A major part of your life insurance safety net remains active.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Better Than Paid-Up:</mark></strong> Unlike making the policy paid-up, here you actually get cash in hand.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">A Clean Exit:</mark></strong> It severs your relationship with a product you don&#8217;t want, without the guilt of &#8220;wasting&#8221; the insurance you already paid for.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Risks of Selling Your ULIPs</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>No solution is perfect. Here&#8217;s what you should consider:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Won&#8217;t Get 100% Value:</mark></strong> The investor is buying your policy at a discount to its surrender value, allowing them to make a profit.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Not All Policies May Find Buyers:</mark></strong> Depending on the terms of your ULIP, remaining tenure, and market conditions, your policy may or may not find interested buyers quickly. Some policies might be more attractive to investors than others.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Platform Dependency:</mark></strong> You are relying on the platform&#8217;s due diligence and operational efficiency. While the payouts are handled by the insurance company, any platform-side hiccups could cause delays, especially in death claims.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">It&#8217;s a relatively new model:</mark></strong> As a new FinTech platform, it doesn&#8217;t fall under any specific regulator. IRDAI regulates the underlying insurance policy, and the assignment process is legal, but the platform itself operates in a newer, less-established space. Future regulatory changes could affect how these transactions work.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Taxes:</mark></strong> The tax implication of selling a policy is a bit of a grey area compared to standard surrender. If you surrender after 5 years, the proceeds are usually tax-free (if premium &lt; ₹2.5 Lakhs). If you sell, you are receiving money from a third party. While it mimics a surrender, you should consult a CA to ensure you don&#8217;t get hit with an unexpected tax demand.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>When Should You Think About Selling Your ULIP?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>So, should you sell, surrender, or discontinue? Let&#8217;s update our decision matrix.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you are still in the lock-in period (and have paid 1-4 premiums):</mark></strong> Selling/Assigning your policy via a platform like The Policy Exchange is likely your best option, assuming the discount on the surrender value is not too high. It helps you exit early with cash in hand while preserving a critical part of your life insurance. It&#8217;s far superior to discontinuing and waiting painfully for the lock-in to end.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If your policy has completed the lock-in period:</mark></strong> Surrendering the policy directly to the insurance company is probably better. At this stage, you can get the full fund value without any charges, and the amount is often tax-free. The hassle of selling might not be worth it since you can exit cleanly on your own.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>The journey of personal finance is about learning and adapting. Making a mistake by investing in a ULIP is not the end of the world. The key is to find the most efficient exit door.</p> <p>The emergence of platforms like The Policy Exchange has created a valuable new exit door for those trapped in the 5-year lock-in. It turns a stagnant, underperforming asset into liquid capital and salvages your life cover, a win-win that wasn&#8217;t easily available before.</p> <p>Before you make any decision, always read the fine print. Check the specific terms of your ULIP policy and understand the exact offer from any platform you use. But for the first time, if you&#8217;re stuck in a ULIP you regret, you have a powerful new tool to break free.</p> <p>Share these insights with your buddies.</p> <ul class="wp-block-social-links

There&#8217;s now a brand-new alternative that could be a game-changer, especially if you&#8217;re stuck in the dreaded 5-year lock-in period.</p> <p>You can now sell (assign) your ULIP policy to someone else.</p> <p>Sounds interesting?

Here we go!</strong></p> <p>Before we discuss this new option, let&#8217;s quickly recap what we had suggested regarding exiting ULIPs.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong>The Old ULIP Playbook: What We Knew Before</strong></strong></h2> <p>Three fundamental ways to exit a ULIP:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Discontinue during the lock-in period:</mark></strong> This is a painful option. You stop paying premiums, but your money gets locked in a &#8220;Discontinuance Fund&#8221; earning a measly ~3.5% interest after charges. You also pay a discontinuance fee and lose your life cover immediately. At the end of the 5-year lock-in, you might get back only 60-70% of what you paid. On top of that, there can be nasty tax implications, reversing your Section 80C benefits.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Surrender after the lock-in period:</mark></strong> This is cleaner. Once the mandatory 5 years are over, you can surrender the policy, get your fund&#8217;s value back with no charges, and the amount is tax-free if your annual premium was under ₹2.5 lakhs. The downside? You have to wait it out, leaving your money stuck in a sub-par product.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Convert to a Paid-up Policy:</mark></strong> We called this the &#8220;worst&#8221; option. After 5 years, you can stop paying premiums, but a reduced sum assured remains. Your money stays locked in the ULIP, and the insurer continues to charge you fees, eroding your potential returns.</li> </ol> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9a1d805a423c711a2e635754c670f1d8" style="font-size:1.2rem"><strong><strong><strong>Our earlier verdict on ULIP exist was simple:</strong></strong></strong></h3> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you&#8217;ve paid premiums for only 1-2 years:</mark> </strong>Bite the bullet and discontinue immediately. Take the financial hit, consider it a lesson fee, and redirect your future cash flows to a pure term insurance and a low-cost index fund.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you&#8217;ve paid premiums for 3 or 4 years:</mark> </strong>The tax hit from reversing 80C deductions is too significant. It&#8217;s often better to wait out the remaining lock-in period and then surrender the policy.</li> </ul> <p>Now, here&#8217;s the problem with our earlier recommendations.</p> <p>If you discontinued during the lock-in period, your money would be stuck earning a measly 3.5% until the lock-in ended. That&#8217;s worse than most savings accounts!</p> <p>And if you decided to wait till the lock-in ended, you&#8217;d have to keep paying premiums for a policy you didn&#8217;t even want. That&#8217;s like continuing to water a dead plant just because you can&#8217;t remove it from your balcony for 5 years.</p> <p>Not ideal, right?</p> <p>What if we told you there is a way to escape the lock-in, get your money now, and here is the kicker, keep your insurance cover active for free?</p> <p>Enter: The Policy Assignment.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>What Is Policy Assignment?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>In simple terms, assignment is the legal transfer of your policy&#8217;s ownership and benefits to another person or entity.</p> <p>A provision called Section 38 of the Insurance Act, 1938, allows a policyholder to transfer (or &#8220;assign&#8221;) their rights in an insurance policy to someone else.</p> <p>There are two main types:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Absolute Assignment:</mark></strong> This is a permanent transfer, usually for money. You are selling all your rights in the policy to the new owner. </li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Collateral Assignment:</mark></strong> This is a temporary transfer, often used as security for a loan (like taking a loan from a bank against your policy). Once the loan is repaid, the policy is transferred back to you.</li> </ol> <p>And recently, we came across a platform called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thepolicyexchange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Policy Exchange</strong></a>. They are essentially building a bridge between people who want to get rid of their policies (you) and investors who want stable returns.</p> <p>They facilitate Absolute Assignment, where you are selling the policy outright.</p> <p>Think of it like selling a second-hand car. You bought it, you don&#8217;t want it anymore, so you transfer the ownership papers to a buyer. The buyer pays you cash, and they take the car.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>How Does The Policy Exchange Platform Work?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Approach the Platform:</mark></strong> You tell The Policy Exchange that you wish to assign your ULIP policy.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">They Value Your Policy:</mark></strong> The platform calculates an approximate value for your policy. This is typically close to the &#8220;surrender value&#8221; you would get from the insurer, but since you&#8217;re selling it before the lock-in ends, it&#8217;s a discounted amount.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Your Policy is Listed:</mark></strong> The policy is listed on their platform for investors to browse. These investors are looking for assets that can give them returns in the 8-12% range.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">An Investor Buys It:</mark></strong> An investor agrees to buy your policy. They pay you the agreed-upon discounted surrender value amount upfront.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">The Transfer is Executed:</mark></strong> The policy is legally assigned to the investor. From this point on, they become the new owners. They are responsible for paying any future premiums (if applicable), and they are entitled to receive the maturity value when the policy matures.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Get Your Money &amp; Retain Partial Cover:</mark></strong> You walk away with a lump sum of cash immediately. And crucially, your life cover doesn&#8217;t completely vanish.</li> </ol> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-d0f2a008fc5be13c0b2eb535a3c2fe28" style="font-size:1.2rem"><strong><strong><strong>Wait, How Do I Still Have Life Cover After Selling My Policy?</strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>This is the interesting part of this arrangement offered by The Policy Exchange. Let&#8217;s break it down with an example.</p> <p>Suppose you sell a policy with a Sum Assured (life cover) of ₹10 Lakhs to an investor for ₹2 Lakhs.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>The investor now owns the policy and is entitled to the maturity benefit.</li> <li>However, if, God forbid, you were to pass away before the policy matures or is surrendered, the insurance company pays out the ₹10 Lakh death claim.</li> <li>This ₹10 Lakh is not given entirely to the investor. The investor is legally entitled to get back their initial investment (₹2 Lakhs) plus the committed return (say, 10%). That comes to ₹2.2 Lakhs.</li> <li>The remaining amount (₹10 Lakhs &#8211; ₹2.2 Lakhs = ₹7.8 Lakhs) is paid to your family/nominee.</li> </ul> <p>So, by selling your ULIP policy, you:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Get immediate liquidity (discounted surrender value).</li> <li>Retain a significant portion of your life cover for your family, which you would have completely lost if you had simply discontinued the policy.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Benefits of Selling Your ULIPs</strong></strong></strong></h2> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Escape the Lock-in Period:</mark></strong> This is the biggest advantage. You don&#8217;t have to wait till the lock-in period ends to access your money. You get a lump sum upfront, which you can then use to buy a proper <a href="https://blog.vrid.in/2022/10/27/why-life-insurance-which-is-the-best-plan-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>term plan</strong></a> and invest in better avenues.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Avoid Financial Bleeding:</mark> </strong>Compared to discontinuing, you will likely get a better financial deal. Instead of your money rotting in a discontinuance fund for years, you get most of its current value in your hand now.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Retain Partial Life Cover:</mark></strong> You don&#8217;t leave your family financially vulnerable. A major part of your life insurance safety net remains active.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Better Than Paid-Up:</mark></strong> Unlike making the policy paid-up, here you actually get cash in hand.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">A Clean Exit:</mark></strong> It severs your relationship with a product you don&#8217;t want, without the guilt of &#8220;wasting&#8221; the insurance you already paid for.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Risks of Selling Your ULIPs</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>No solution is perfect. Here&#8217;s what you should consider:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Won&#8217;t Get 100% Value:</mark></strong> The investor is buying your policy at a discount to its surrender value, allowing them to make a profit.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Not All Policies May Find Buyers:</mark></strong> Depending on the terms of your ULIP, remaining tenure, and market conditions, your policy may or may not find interested buyers quickly. Some policies might be more attractive to investors than others.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Platform Dependency:</mark></strong> You are relying on the platform&#8217;s due diligence and operational efficiency. While the payouts are handled by the insurance company, any platform-side hiccups could cause delays, especially in death claims.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">It&#8217;s a relatively new model:</mark></strong> As a new FinTech platform, it doesn&#8217;t fall under any specific regulator. IRDAI regulates the underlying insurance policy, and the assignment process is legal, but the platform itself operates in a newer, less-established space. Future regulatory changes could affect how these transactions work.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Taxes:</mark></strong> The tax implication of selling a policy is a bit of a grey area compared to standard surrender. If you surrender after 5 years, the proceeds are usually tax-free (if premium &lt; ₹2.5 Lakhs). If you sell, you are receiving money from a third party. While it mimics a surrender, you should consult a CA to ensure you don&#8217;t get hit with an unexpected tax demand.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>When Should You Think About Selling Your ULIP?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>So, should you sell, surrender, or discontinue? Let&#8217;s update our decision matrix.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you are still in the lock-in period (and have paid 1-4 premiums):</mark></strong> Selling/Assigning your policy via a platform like The Policy Exchange is likely your best option, assuming the discount on the surrender value is not too high. It helps you exit early with cash in hand while preserving a critical part of your life insurance. It&#8217;s far superior to discontinuing and waiting painfully for the lock-in to end.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If your policy has completed the lock-in period:</mark></strong> Surrendering the policy directly to the insurance company is probably better. At this stage, you can get the full fund value without any charges, and the amount is often tax-free. The hassle of selling might not be worth it since you can exit cleanly on your own.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>The journey of personal finance is about learning and adapting. Making a mistake by investing in a ULIP is not the end of the world. The key is to find the most efficient exit door.</p> <p>The emergence of platforms like The Policy Exchange has created a valuable new exit door for those trapped in the 5-year lock-in. It turns a stagnant, underperforming asset into liquid capital and salvages your life cover, a win-win that wasn&#8217;t easily available before.</p> <p>Before you make any decision, always read the fine print. Check the specific terms of your ULIP policy and understand the exact offer from any platform you use. But for the first time, if you&#8217;re stuck in a ULIP you regret, you have a powerful new tool to break free.</p> <p>Share these insights with your buddies.</p> <ul class="wp-block-social-links

There&#8217;s now a brand-new alternative that could be a game-changer, especially if you&#8217;re stuck in the dreaded 5-year lock-in period.</p> <p>You can now sell (assign) your ULIP policy to someone else.</p> <p>Sounds interesting?

Here we go!</strong></p> <p>Before we discuss this new option, let&#8217;s quickly recap what we had suggested regarding exiting ULIPs.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong>The Old ULIP Playbook: What We Knew Before</strong></strong></h2> <p>Three fundamental ways to exit a ULIP:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Discontinue during the lock-in period:</mark></strong> This is a painful option. You stop paying premiums, but your money gets locked in a &#8220;Discontinuance Fund&#8221; earning a measly ~3.5% interest after charges. You also pay a discontinuance fee and lose your life cover immediately. At the end of the 5-year lock-in, you might get back only 60-70% of what you paid. On top of that, there can be nasty tax implications, reversing your Section 80C benefits.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Surrender after the lock-in period:</mark></strong> This is cleaner. Once the mandatory 5 years are over, you can surrender the policy, get your fund&#8217;s value back with no charges, and the amount is tax-free if your annual premium was under ₹2.5 lakhs. The downside? You have to wait it out, leaving your money stuck in a sub-par product.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Convert to a Paid-up Policy:</mark></strong> We called this the &#8220;worst&#8221; option. After 5 years, you can stop paying premiums, but a reduced sum assured remains. Your money stays locked in the ULIP, and the insurer continues to charge you fees, eroding your potential returns.</li> </ol> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9a1d805a423c711a2e635754c670f1d8" style="font-size:1.2rem"><strong><strong><strong>Our earlier verdict on ULIP exist was simple:</strong></strong></strong></h3> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you&#8217;ve paid premiums for only 1-2 years:</mark> </strong>Bite the bullet and discontinue immediately. Take the financial hit, consider it a lesson fee, and redirect your future cash flows to a pure term insurance and a low-cost index fund.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you&#8217;ve paid premiums for 3 or 4 years:</mark> </strong>The tax hit from reversing 80C deductions is too significant. It&#8217;s often better to wait out the remaining lock-in period and then surrender the policy.</li> </ul> <p>Now, here&#8217;s the problem with our earlier recommendations.</p> <p>If you discontinued during the lock-in period, your money would be stuck earning a measly 3.5% until the lock-in ended. That&#8217;s worse than most savings accounts!</p> <p>And if you decided to wait till the lock-in ended, you&#8217;d have to keep paying premiums for a policy you didn&#8217;t even want. That&#8217;s like continuing to water a dead plant just because you can&#8217;t remove it from your balcony for 5 years.</p> <p>Not ideal, right?</p> <p>What if we told you there is a way to escape the lock-in, get your money now, and here is the kicker, keep your insurance cover active for free?</p> <p>Enter: The Policy Assignment.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>What Is Policy Assignment?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>In simple terms, assignment is the legal transfer of your policy&#8217;s ownership and benefits to another person or entity.</p> <p>A provision called Section 38 of the Insurance Act, 1938, allows a policyholder to transfer (or &#8220;assign&#8221;) their rights in an insurance policy to someone else.</p> <p>There are two main types:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Absolute Assignment:</mark></strong> This is a permanent transfer, usually for money. You are selling all your rights in the policy to the new owner. </li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Collateral Assignment:</mark></strong> This is a temporary transfer, often used as security for a loan (like taking a loan from a bank against your policy). Once the loan is repaid, the policy is transferred back to you.</li> </ol> <p>And recently, we came across a platform called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thepolicyexchange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Policy Exchange</strong></a>. They are essentially building a bridge between people who want to get rid of their policies (you) and investors who want stable returns.</p> <p>They facilitate Absolute Assignment, where you are selling the policy outright.</p> <p>Think of it like selling a second-hand car. You bought it, you don&#8217;t want it anymore, so you transfer the ownership papers to a buyer. The buyer pays you cash, and they take the car.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>How Does The Policy Exchange Platform Work?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Approach the Platform:</mark></strong> You tell The Policy Exchange that you wish to assign your ULIP policy.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">They Value Your Policy:</mark></strong> The platform calculates an approximate value for your policy. This is typically close to the &#8220;surrender value&#8221; you would get from the insurer, but since you&#8217;re selling it before the lock-in ends, it&#8217;s a discounted amount.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Your Policy is Listed:</mark></strong> The policy is listed on their platform for investors to browse. These investors are looking for assets that can give them returns in the 8-12% range.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">An Investor Buys It:</mark></strong> An investor agrees to buy your policy. They pay you the agreed-upon discounted surrender value amount upfront.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">The Transfer is Executed:</mark></strong> The policy is legally assigned to the investor. From this point on, they become the new owners. They are responsible for paying any future premiums (if applicable), and they are entitled to receive the maturity value when the policy matures.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Get Your Money &amp; Retain Partial Cover:</mark></strong> You walk away with a lump sum of cash immediately. And crucially, your life cover doesn&#8217;t completely vanish.</li> </ol> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-d0f2a008fc5be13c0b2eb535a3c2fe28" style="font-size:1.2rem"><strong><strong><strong>Wait, How Do I Still Have Life Cover After Selling My Policy?</strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>This is the interesting part of this arrangement offered by The Policy Exchange. Let&#8217;s break it down with an example.</p> <p>Suppose you sell a policy with a Sum Assured (life cover) of ₹10 Lakhs to an investor for ₹2 Lakhs.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>The investor now owns the policy and is entitled to the maturity benefit.</li> <li>However, if, God forbid, you were to pass away before the policy matures or is surrendered, the insurance company pays out the ₹10 Lakh death claim.</li> <li>This ₹10 Lakh is not given entirely to the investor. The investor is legally entitled to get back their initial investment (₹2 Lakhs) plus the committed return (say, 10%). That comes to ₹2.2 Lakhs.</li> <li>The remaining amount (₹10 Lakhs &#8211; ₹2.2 Lakhs = ₹7.8 Lakhs) is paid to your family/nominee.</li> </ul> <p>So, by selling your ULIP policy, you:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Get immediate liquidity (discounted surrender value).</li> <li>Retain a significant portion of your life cover for your family, which you would have completely lost if you had simply discontinued the policy.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Benefits of Selling Your ULIPs</strong></strong></strong></h2> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Escape the Lock-in Period:</mark></strong> This is the biggest advantage. You don&#8217;t have to wait till the lock-in period ends to access your money. You get a lump sum upfront, which you can then use to buy a proper <a href="https://blog.vrid.in/2022/10/27/why-life-insurance-which-is-the-best-plan-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>term plan</strong></a> and invest in better avenues.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Avoid Financial Bleeding:</mark> </strong>Compared to discontinuing, you will likely get a better financial deal. Instead of your money rotting in a discontinuance fund for years, you get most of its current value in your hand now.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Retain Partial Life Cover:</mark></strong> You don&#8217;t leave your family financially vulnerable. A major part of your life insurance safety net remains active.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Better Than Paid-Up:</mark></strong> Unlike making the policy paid-up, here you actually get cash in hand.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">A Clean Exit:</mark></strong> It severs your relationship with a product you don&#8217;t want, without the guilt of &#8220;wasting&#8221; the insurance you already paid for.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Risks of Selling Your ULIPs</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>No solution is perfect. Here&#8217;s what you should consider:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Won&#8217;t Get 100% Value:</mark></strong> The investor is buying your policy at a discount to its surrender value, allowing them to make a profit.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Not All Policies May Find Buyers:</mark></strong> Depending on the terms of your ULIP, remaining tenure, and market conditions, your policy may or may not find interested buyers quickly. Some policies might be more attractive to investors than others.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Platform Dependency:</mark></strong> You are relying on the platform&#8217;s due diligence and operational efficiency. While the payouts are handled by the insurance company, any platform-side hiccups could cause delays, especially in death claims.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">It&#8217;s a relatively new model:</mark></strong> As a new FinTech platform, it doesn&#8217;t fall under any specific regulator. IRDAI regulates the underlying insurance policy, and the assignment process is legal, but the platform itself operates in a newer, less-established space. Future regulatory changes could affect how these transactions work.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Taxes:</mark></strong> The tax implication of selling a policy is a bit of a grey area compared to standard surrender. If you surrender after 5 years, the proceeds are usually tax-free (if premium &lt; ₹2.5 Lakhs). If you sell, you are receiving money from a third party. While it mimics a surrender, you should consult a CA to ensure you don&#8217;t get hit with an unexpected tax demand.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>When Should You Think About Selling Your ULIP?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>So, should you sell, surrender, or discontinue? Let&#8217;s update our decision matrix.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you are still in the lock-in period (and have paid 1-4 premiums):</mark></strong> Selling/Assigning your policy via a platform like The Policy Exchange is likely your best option, assuming the discount on the surrender value is not too high. It helps you exit early with cash in hand while preserving a critical part of your life insurance. It&#8217;s far superior to discontinuing and waiting painfully for the lock-in to end.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If your policy has completed the lock-in period:</mark></strong> Surrendering the policy directly to the insurance company is probably better. At this stage, you can get the full fund value without any charges, and the amount is often tax-free. The hassle of selling might not be worth it since you can exit cleanly on your own.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>The journey of personal finance is about learning and adapting. Making a mistake by investing in a ULIP is not the end of the world. The key is to find the most efficient exit door.</p> <p>The emergence of platforms like The Policy Exchange has created a valuable new exit door for those trapped in the 5-year lock-in. It turns a stagnant, underperforming asset into liquid capital and salvages your life cover, a win-win that wasn&#8217;t easily available before.</p> <p>Before you make any decision, always read the fine print. Check the specific terms of your ULIP policy and understand the exact offer from any platform you use. But for the first time, if you&#8217;re stuck in a ULIP you regret, you have a powerful new tool to break free.</p> <p>Share these insights with your buddies.</p> <ul class="wp-block-social-links

There&#8217;s now a brand-new alternative that could be a game-changer, especially if you&#8217;re stuck in the dreaded 5-year lock-in period.</p> <p>You can now sell (assign) your ULIP policy to someone else.</p> <p>Sounds interesting?

Here we go!</strong></p> <p>Before we discuss this new option, let&#8217;s quickly recap what we had suggested regarding exiting ULIPs.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong>The Old ULIP Playbook: What We Knew Before</strong></strong></h2> <p>Three fundamental ways to exit a ULIP:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Discontinue during the lock-in period:</mark></strong> This is a painful option. You stop paying premiums, but your money gets locked in a &#8220;Discontinuance Fund&#8221; earning a measly ~3.5% interest after charges. You also pay a discontinuance fee and lose your life cover immediately. At the end of the 5-year lock-in, you might get back only 60-70% of what you paid. On top of that, there can be nasty tax implications, reversing your Section 80C benefits.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Surrender after the lock-in period:</mark></strong> This is cleaner. Once the mandatory 5 years are over, you can surrender the policy, get your fund&#8217;s value back with no charges, and the amount is tax-free if your annual premium was under ₹2.5 lakhs. The downside? You have to wait it out, leaving your money stuck in a sub-par product.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Convert to a Paid-up Policy:</mark></strong> We called this the &#8220;worst&#8221; option. After 5 years, you can stop paying premiums, but a reduced sum assured remains. Your money stays locked in the ULIP, and the insurer continues to charge you fees, eroding your potential returns.</li> </ol> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9a1d805a423c711a2e635754c670f1d8" style="font-size:1.2rem"><strong><strong><strong>Our earlier verdict on ULIP exist was simple:</strong></strong></strong></h3> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you&#8217;ve paid premiums for only 1-2 years:</mark> </strong>Bite the bullet and discontinue immediately. Take the financial hit, consider it a lesson fee, and redirect your future cash flows to a pure term insurance and a low-cost index fund.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you&#8217;ve paid premiums for 3 or 4 years:</mark> </strong>The tax hit from reversing 80C deductions is too significant. It&#8217;s often better to wait out the remaining lock-in period and then surrender the policy.</li> </ul> <p>Now, here&#8217;s the problem with our earlier recommendations.</p> <p>If you discontinued during the lock-in period, your money would be stuck earning a measly 3.5% until the lock-in ended. That&#8217;s worse than most savings accounts!</p> <p>And if you decided to wait till the lock-in ended, you&#8217;d have to keep paying premiums for a policy you didn&#8217;t even want. That&#8217;s like continuing to water a dead plant just because you can&#8217;t remove it from your balcony for 5 years.</p> <p>Not ideal, right?</p> <p>What if we told you there is a way to escape the lock-in, get your money now, and here is the kicker, keep your insurance cover active for free?</p> <p>Enter: The Policy Assignment.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>What Is Policy Assignment?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>In simple terms, assignment is the legal transfer of your policy&#8217;s ownership and benefits to another person or entity.</p> <p>A provision called Section 38 of the Insurance Act, 1938, allows a policyholder to transfer (or &#8220;assign&#8221;) their rights in an insurance policy to someone else.</p> <p>There are two main types:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Absolute Assignment:</mark></strong> This is a permanent transfer, usually for money. You are selling all your rights in the policy to the new owner. </li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Collateral Assignment:</mark></strong> This is a temporary transfer, often used as security for a loan (like taking a loan from a bank against your policy). Once the loan is repaid, the policy is transferred back to you.</li> </ol> <p>And recently, we came across a platform called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thepolicyexchange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Policy Exchange</strong></a>. They are essentially building a bridge between people who want to get rid of their policies (you) and investors who want stable returns.</p> <p>They facilitate Absolute Assignment, where you are selling the policy outright.</p> <p>Think of it like selling a second-hand car. You bought it, you don&#8217;t want it anymore, so you transfer the ownership papers to a buyer. The buyer pays you cash, and they take the car.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>How Does The Policy Exchange Platform Work?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Approach the Platform:</mark></strong> You tell The Policy Exchange that you wish to assign your ULIP policy.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">They Value Your Policy:</mark></strong> The platform calculates an approximate value for your policy. This is typically close to the &#8220;surrender value&#8221; you would get from the insurer, but since you&#8217;re selling it before the lock-in ends, it&#8217;s a discounted amount.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Your Policy is Listed:</mark></strong> The policy is listed on their platform for investors to browse. These investors are looking for assets that can give them returns in the 8-12% range.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">An Investor Buys It:</mark></strong> An investor agrees to buy your policy. They pay you the agreed-upon discounted surrender value amount upfront.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">The Transfer is Executed:</mark></strong> The policy is legally assigned to the investor. From this point on, they become the new owners. They are responsible for paying any future premiums (if applicable), and they are entitled to receive the maturity value when the policy matures.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Get Your Money &amp; Retain Partial Cover:</mark></strong> You walk away with a lump sum of cash immediately. And crucially, your life cover doesn&#8217;t completely vanish.</li> </ol> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-d0f2a008fc5be13c0b2eb535a3c2fe28" style="font-size:1.2rem"><strong><strong><strong>Wait, How Do I Still Have Life Cover After Selling My Policy?</strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>This is the interesting part of this arrangement offered by The Policy Exchange. Let&#8217;s break it down with an example.</p> <p>Suppose you sell a policy with a Sum Assured (life cover) of ₹10 Lakhs to an investor for ₹2 Lakhs.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>The investor now owns the policy and is entitled to the maturity benefit.</li> <li>However, if, God forbid, you were to pass away before the policy matures or is surrendered, the insurance company pays out the ₹10 Lakh death claim.</li> <li>This ₹10 Lakh is not given entirely to the investor. The investor is legally entitled to get back their initial investment (₹2 Lakhs) plus the committed return (say, 10%). That comes to ₹2.2 Lakhs.</li> <li>The remaining amount (₹10 Lakhs &#8211; ₹2.2 Lakhs = ₹7.8 Lakhs) is paid to your family/nominee.</li> </ul> <p>So, by selling your ULIP policy, you:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Get immediate liquidity (discounted surrender value).</li> <li>Retain a significant portion of your life cover for your family, which you would have completely lost if you had simply discontinued the policy.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Benefits of Selling Your ULIPs</strong></strong></strong></h2> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Escape the Lock-in Period:</mark></strong> This is the biggest advantage. You don&#8217;t have to wait till the lock-in period ends to access your money. You get a lump sum upfront, which you can then use to buy a proper <a href="https://blog.vrid.in/2022/10/27/why-life-insurance-which-is-the-best-plan-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>term plan</strong></a> and invest in better avenues.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Avoid Financial Bleeding:</mark> </strong>Compared to discontinuing, you will likely get a better financial deal. Instead of your money rotting in a discontinuance fund for years, you get most of its current value in your hand now.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Retain Partial Life Cover:</mark></strong> You don&#8217;t leave your family financially vulnerable. A major part of your life insurance safety net remains active.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Better Than Paid-Up:</mark></strong> Unlike making the policy paid-up, here you actually get cash in hand.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">A Clean Exit:</mark></strong> It severs your relationship with a product you don&#8217;t want, without the guilt of &#8220;wasting&#8221; the insurance you already paid for.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Risks of Selling Your ULIPs</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>No solution is perfect. Here&#8217;s what you should consider:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Won&#8217;t Get 100% Value:</mark></strong> The investor is buying your policy at a discount to its surrender value, allowing them to make a profit.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Not All Policies May Find Buyers:</mark></strong> Depending on the terms of your ULIP, remaining tenure, and market conditions, your policy may or may not find interested buyers quickly. Some policies might be more attractive to investors than others.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Platform Dependency:</mark></strong> You are relying on the platform&#8217;s due diligence and operational efficiency. While the payouts are handled by the insurance company, any platform-side hiccups could cause delays, especially in death claims.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">It&#8217;s a relatively new model:</mark></strong> As a new FinTech platform, it doesn&#8217;t fall under any specific regulator. IRDAI regulates the underlying insurance policy, and the assignment process is legal, but the platform itself operates in a newer, less-established space. Future regulatory changes could affect how these transactions work.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Taxes:</mark></strong> The tax implication of selling a policy is a bit of a grey area compared to standard surrender. If you surrender after 5 years, the proceeds are usually tax-free (if premium &lt; ₹2.5 Lakhs). If you sell, you are receiving money from a third party. While it mimics a surrender, you should consult a CA to ensure you don&#8217;t get hit with an unexpected tax demand.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>When Should You Think About Selling Your ULIP?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>So, should you sell, surrender, or discontinue? Let&#8217;s update our decision matrix.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you are still in the lock-in period (and have paid 1-4 premiums):</mark></strong> Selling/Assigning your policy via a platform like The Policy Exchange is likely your best option, assuming the discount on the surrender value is not too high. It helps you exit early with cash in hand while preserving a critical part of your life insurance. It&#8217;s far superior to discontinuing and waiting painfully for the lock-in to end.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If your policy has completed the lock-in period:</mark></strong> Surrendering the policy directly to the insurance company is probably better. At this stage, you can get the full fund value without any charges, and the amount is often tax-free. The hassle of selling might not be worth it since you can exit cleanly on your own.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>The journey of personal finance is about learning and adapting. Making a mistake by investing in a ULIP is not the end of the world. The key is to find the most efficient exit door.</p> <p>The emergence of platforms like The Policy Exchange has created a valuable new exit door for those trapped in the 5-year lock-in. It turns a stagnant, underperforming asset into liquid capital and salvages your life cover, a win-win that wasn&#8217;t easily available before.</p> <p>Before you make any decision, always read the fine print. Check the specific terms of your ULIP policy and understand the exact offer from any platform you use. But for the first time, if you&#8217;re stuck in a ULIP you regret, you have a powerful new tool to break free.</p> <p>Share these insights with your buddies.</p> <ul class="wp-block-social-links

There&#8217;s now a brand-new alternative that could be a game-changer, especially if you&#8217;re stuck in the dreaded 5-year lock-in period.</p> <p>You can now sell (assign) your ULIP policy to someone else.</p> <p>Sounds interesting?

Here we go!</strong></p> <p>Before we discuss this new option, let&#8217;s quickly recap what we had suggested regarding exiting ULIPs.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong>The Old ULIP Playbook: What We Knew Before</strong></strong></h2> <p>Three fundamental ways to exit a ULIP:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Discontinue during the lock-in period:</mark></strong> This is a painful option. You stop paying premiums, but your money gets locked in a &#8220;Discontinuance Fund&#8221; earning a measly ~3.5% interest after charges. You also pay a discontinuance fee and lose your life cover immediately. At the end of the 5-year lock-in, you might get back only 60-70% of what you paid. On top of that, there can be nasty tax implications, reversing your Section 80C benefits.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Surrender after the lock-in period:</mark></strong> This is cleaner. Once the mandatory 5 years are over, you can surrender the policy, get your fund&#8217;s value back with no charges, and the amount is tax-free if your annual premium was under ₹2.5 lakhs. The downside? You have to wait it out, leaving your money stuck in a sub-par product.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Convert to a Paid-up Policy:</mark></strong> We called this the &#8220;worst&#8221; option. After 5 years, you can stop paying premiums, but a reduced sum assured remains. Your money stays locked in the ULIP, and the insurer continues to charge you fees, eroding your potential returns.</li> </ol> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9a1d805a423c711a2e635754c670f1d8" style="font-size:1.2rem"><strong><strong><strong>Our earlier verdict on ULIP exist was simple:</strong></strong></strong></h3> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you&#8217;ve paid premiums for only 1-2 years:</mark> </strong>Bite the bullet and discontinue immediately. Take the financial hit, consider it a lesson fee, and redirect your future cash flows to a pure term insurance and a low-cost index fund.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you&#8217;ve paid premiums for 3 or 4 years:</mark> </strong>The tax hit from reversing 80C deductions is too significant. It&#8217;s often better to wait out the remaining lock-in period and then surrender the policy.</li> </ul> <p>Now, here&#8217;s the problem with our earlier recommendations.</p> <p>If you discontinued during the lock-in period, your money would be stuck earning a measly 3.5% until the lock-in ended. That&#8217;s worse than most savings accounts!</p> <p>And if you decided to wait till the lock-in ended, you&#8217;d have to keep paying premiums for a policy you didn&#8217;t even want. That&#8217;s like continuing to water a dead plant just because you can&#8217;t remove it from your balcony for 5 years.</p> <p>Not ideal, right?</p> <p>What if we told you there is a way to escape the lock-in, get your money now, and here is the kicker, keep your insurance cover active for free?</p> <p>Enter: The Policy Assignment.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>What Is Policy Assignment?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>In simple terms, assignment is the legal transfer of your policy&#8217;s ownership and benefits to another person or entity.</p> <p>A provision called Section 38 of the Insurance Act, 1938, allows a policyholder to transfer (or &#8220;assign&#8221;) their rights in an insurance policy to someone else.</p> <p>There are two main types:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Absolute Assignment:</mark></strong> This is a permanent transfer, usually for money. You are selling all your rights in the policy to the new owner. </li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Collateral Assignment:</mark></strong> This is a temporary transfer, often used as security for a loan (like taking a loan from a bank against your policy). Once the loan is repaid, the policy is transferred back to you.</li> </ol> <p>And recently, we came across a platform called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thepolicyexchange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Policy Exchange</strong></a>. They are essentially building a bridge between people who want to get rid of their policies (you) and investors who want stable returns.</p> <p>They facilitate Absolute Assignment, where you are selling the policy outright.</p> <p>Think of it like selling a second-hand car. You bought it, you don&#8217;t want it anymore, so you transfer the ownership papers to a buyer. The buyer pays you cash, and they take the car.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>How Does The Policy Exchange Platform Work?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Approach the Platform:</mark></strong> You tell The Policy Exchange that you wish to assign your ULIP policy.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">They Value Your Policy:</mark></strong> The platform calculates an approximate value for your policy. This is typically close to the &#8220;surrender value&#8221; you would get from the insurer, but since you&#8217;re selling it before the lock-in ends, it&#8217;s a discounted amount.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Your Policy is Listed:</mark></strong> The policy is listed on their platform for investors to browse. These investors are looking for assets that can give them returns in the 8-12% range.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">An Investor Buys It:</mark></strong> An investor agrees to buy your policy. They pay you the agreed-upon discounted surrender value amount upfront.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">The Transfer is Executed:</mark></strong> The policy is legally assigned to the investor. From this point on, they become the new owners. They are responsible for paying any future premiums (if applicable), and they are entitled to receive the maturity value when the policy matures.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Get Your Money &amp; Retain Partial Cover:</mark></strong> You walk away with a lump sum of cash immediately.

Let&#8217;s break it down with an example.</p> <p>Suppose you sell a policy with a Sum Assured (life cover) of ₹10 Lakhs to an investor for ₹2 Lakhs.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>The investor now owns the policy and is entitled to the maturity benefit.</li> <li>However, if, God forbid, you were to pass away before the policy matures or is surrendered, the insurance company pays out the ₹10 Lakh death claim.</li> <li>This ₹10 Lakh is not given entirely to the investor. The investor is legally entitled to get back their initial investment (₹2 Lakhs) plus the committed return (say, 10%). That comes to ₹2.2 Lakhs.</li> <li>The remaining amount (₹10 Lakhs &#8211; ₹2.2 Lakhs = ₹7.8 Lakhs) is paid to your family/nominee.</li> </ul> <p>So, by selling your ULIP policy, you:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Get immediate liquidity (discounted surrender value).</li> <li>Retain a significant portion of your life cover for your family, which you would have completely lost if you had simply discontinued the policy.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Benefits of Selling Your ULIPs</strong></strong></strong></h2> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Escape the Lock-in Period:</mark></strong> This is the biggest advantage. You don&#8217;t have to wait till the lock-in period ends to access your money. You get a lump sum upfront, which you can then use to buy a proper <a href="https://blog.vrid.in/2022/10/27/why-life-insurance-which-is-the-best-plan-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>term plan</strong></a> and invest in better avenues.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Avoid Financial Bleeding:</mark> </strong>Compared to discontinuing, you will likely get a better financial deal. Instead of your money rotting in a discontinuance fund for years, you get most of its current value in your hand now.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Retain Partial Life Cover:</mark></strong> You don&#8217;t leave your family financially vulnerable. A major part of your life insurance safety net remains active.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Better Than Paid-Up:</mark></strong> Unlike making the policy paid-up, here you actually get cash in hand.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">A Clean Exit:</mark></strong> It severs your relationship with a product you don&#8217;t want, without the guilt of &#8220;wasting&#8221; the insurance you already paid for.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Risks of Selling Your ULIPs</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>No solution is perfect. Here&#8217;s what you should consider:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Won&#8217;t Get 100% Value:</mark></strong> The investor is buying your policy at a discount to its surrender value, allowing them to make a profit.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Not All Policies May Find Buyers:</mark></strong> Depending on the terms of your ULIP, remaining tenure, and market conditions, your policy may or may not find interested buyers quickly. Some policies might be more attractive to investors than others.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Platform Dependency:</mark></strong> You are relying on the platform&#8217;s due diligence and operational efficiency. While the payouts are handled by the insurance company, any platform-side hiccups could cause delays, especially in death claims.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">It&#8217;s a relatively new model:</mark></strong> As a new FinTech platform, it doesn&#8217;t fall under any specific regulator. IRDAI regulates the underlying insurance policy, and the assignment process is legal, but the platform itself operates in a newer, less-established space. Future regulatory changes could affect how these transactions work.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Taxes:</mark></strong> The tax implication of selling a policy is a bit of a grey area compared to standard surrender. If you surrender after 5 years, the proceeds are usually tax-free (if premium &lt; ₹2.5 Lakhs). If you sell, you are receiving money from a third party. While it mimics a surrender, you should consult a CA to ensure you don&#8217;t get hit with an unexpected tax demand.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>When Should You Think About Selling Your ULIP?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>So, should you sell, surrender, or discontinue? Let&#8217;s update our decision matrix.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you are still in the lock-in period (and have paid 1-4 premiums):</mark></strong> Selling/Assigning your policy via a platform like The Policy Exchange is likely your best option, assuming the discount on the surrender value is not too high. It helps you exit early with cash in hand while preserving a critical part of your life insurance. It&#8217;s far superior to discontinuing and waiting painfully for the lock-in to end.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If your policy has completed the lock-in period:</mark></strong> Surrendering the policy directly to the insurance company is probably better. At this stage, you can get the full fund value without any charges, and the amount is often tax-free. The hassle of selling might not be worth it since you can exit cleanly on your own.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>The journey of personal finance is about learning and adapting. Making a mistake by investing in a ULIP is not the end of the world. The key is to find the most efficient exit door.</p> <p>The emergence of platforms like The Policy Exchange has created a valuable new exit door for those trapped in the 5-year lock-in. It turns a stagnant, underperforming asset into liquid capital and salvages your life cover, a win-win that wasn&#8217;t easily available before.</p> <p>Before you make any decision, always read the fine print. Check the specific terms of your ULIP policy and understand the exact offer from any platform you use. But for the first time, if you&#8217;re stuck in a ULIP you regret, you have a powerful new tool to break free.</p> <p>Share these insights with your buddies.</p> <ul class="wp-block-social-links

There&#8217;s now a brand-new alternative that could be a game-changer, especially if you&#8217;re stuck in the dreaded 5-year lock-in period.</p> <p>You can now sell (assign) your ULIP policy to someone else.</p> <p>Sounds interesting?

Here we go!</strong></p> <p>Before we discuss this new option, let&#8217;s quickly recap what we had suggested regarding exiting ULIPs.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong>The Old ULIP Playbook: What We Knew Before</strong></strong></h2> <p>Three fundamental ways to exit a ULIP:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Discontinue during the lock-in period:</mark></strong> This is a painful option. You stop paying premiums, but your money gets locked in a &#8220;Discontinuance Fund&#8221; earning a measly ~3.5% interest after charges. You also pay a discontinuance fee and lose your life cover immediately. At the end of the 5-year lock-in, you might get back only 60-70% of what you paid. On top of that, there can be nasty tax implications, reversing your Section 80C benefits.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Surrender after the lock-in period:</mark></strong> This is cleaner. Once the mandatory 5 years are over, you can surrender the policy, get your fund&#8217;s value back with no charges, and the amount is tax-free if your annual premium was under ₹2.5 lakhs. The downside? You have to wait it out, leaving your money stuck in a sub-par product.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Convert to a Paid-up Policy:</mark></strong> We called this the &#8220;worst&#8221; option. After 5 years, you can stop paying premiums, but a reduced sum assured remains. Your money stays locked in the ULIP, and the insurer continues to charge you fees, eroding your potential returns.</li> </ol> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9a1d805a423c711a2e635754c670f1d8" style="font-size:1.2rem"><strong><strong><strong>Our earlier verdict on ULIP exist was simple:</strong></strong></strong></h3> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you&#8217;ve paid premiums for only 1-2 years:</mark> </strong>Bite the bullet and discontinue immediately. Take the financial hit, consider it a lesson fee, and redirect your future cash flows to a pure term insurance and a low-cost index fund.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you&#8217;ve paid premiums for 3 or 4 years:</mark> </strong>The tax hit from reversing 80C deductions is too significant. It&#8217;s often better to wait out the remaining lock-in period and then surrender the policy.</li> </ul> <p>Now, here&#8217;s the problem with our earlier recommendations.</p> <p>If you discontinued during the lock-in period, your money would be stuck earning a measly 3.5% until the lock-in ended. That&#8217;s worse than most savings accounts!</p> <p>And if you decided to wait till the lock-in ended, you&#8217;d have to keep paying premiums for a policy you didn&#8217;t even want. That&#8217;s like continuing to water a dead plant just because you can&#8217;t remove it from your balcony for 5 years.</p> <p>Not ideal, right?</p> <p>What if we told you there is a way to escape the lock-in, get your money now, and here is the kicker, keep your insurance cover active for free?</p> <p>Enter: The Policy Assignment.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>What Is Policy Assignment?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>In simple terms, assignment is the legal transfer of your policy&#8217;s ownership and benefits to another person or entity.</p> <p>A provision called Section 38 of the Insurance Act, 1938, allows a policyholder to transfer (or &#8220;assign&#8221;) their rights in an insurance policy to someone else.</p> <p>There are two main types:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Absolute Assignment:</mark></strong> This is a permanent transfer, usually for money. You are selling all your rights in the policy to the new owner. </li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Collateral Assignment:</mark></strong> This is a temporary transfer, often used as security for a loan (like taking a loan from a bank against your policy). Once the loan is repaid, the policy is transferred back to you.</li> </ol> <p>And recently, we came across a platform called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thepolicyexchange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Policy Exchange</strong></a>. They are essentially building a bridge between people who want to get rid of their policies (you) and investors who want stable returns.</p> <p>They facilitate Absolute Assignment, where you are selling the policy outright.</p> <p>Think of it like selling a second-hand car. You bought it, you don&#8217;t want it anymore, so you transfer the ownership papers to a buyer. The buyer pays you cash, and they take the car.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>How Does The Policy Exchange Platform Work?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Approach the Platform:</mark></strong> You tell The Policy Exchange that you wish to assign your ULIP policy.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">They Value Your Policy:</mark></strong> The platform calculates an approximate value for your policy. This is typically close to the &#8220;surrender value&#8221; you would get from the insurer, but since you&#8217;re selling it before the lock-in ends, it&#8217;s a discounted amount.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Your Policy is Listed:</mark></strong> The policy is listed on their platform for investors to browse. These investors are looking for assets that can give them returns in the 8-12% range.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">An Investor Buys It:</mark></strong> An investor agrees to buy your policy. They pay you the agreed-upon discounted surrender value amount upfront.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">The Transfer is Executed:</mark></strong> The policy is legally assigned to the investor. From this point on, they become the new owners. They are responsible for paying any future premiums (if applicable), and they are entitled to receive the maturity value when the policy matures.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Get Your Money &amp; Retain Partial Cover:</mark></strong> You walk away with a lump sum of cash immediately. And crucially, your life cover doesn&#8217;t completely vanish.</li> </ol> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-d0f2a008fc5be13c0b2eb535a3c2fe28" style="font-size:1.2rem"><strong><strong><strong>Wait, How Do I Still Have Life Cover After Selling My Policy?</strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>This is the interesting part of this arrangement offered by The Policy Exchange. Let&#8217;s break it down with an example.</p> <p>Suppose you sell a policy with a Sum Assured (life cover) of ₹10 Lakhs to an investor for ₹2 Lakhs.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>The investor now owns the policy and is entitled to the maturity benefit.</li> <li>However, if, God forbid, you were to pass away before the policy matures or is surrendered, the insurance company pays out the ₹10 Lakh death claim.</li> <li>This ₹10 Lakh is not given entirely to the investor. The investor is legally entitled to get back their initial investment (₹2 Lakhs) plus the committed return (say, 10%). That comes to ₹2.2 Lakhs.</li> <li>The remaining amount (₹10 Lakhs &#8211; ₹2.2 Lakhs = ₹7.8 Lakhs) is paid to your family/nominee.</li> </ul> <p>So, by selling your ULIP policy, you:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Get immediate liquidity (discounted surrender value).</li> <li>Retain a significant portion of your life cover for your family, which you would have completely lost if you had simply discontinued the policy.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Benefits of Selling Your ULIPs</strong></strong></strong></h2> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Escape the Lock-in Period:</mark></strong> This is the biggest advantage. You don&#8217;t have to wait till the lock-in period ends to access your money. You get a lump sum upfront, which you can then use to buy a proper <a href="https://blog.vrid.in/2022/10/27/why-life-insurance-which-is-the-best-plan-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>term plan</strong></a> and invest in better avenues.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Avoid Financial Bleeding:</mark> </strong>Compared to discontinuing, you will likely get a better financial deal. Instead of your money rotting in a discontinuance fund for years, you get most of its current value in your hand now.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Retain Partial Life Cover:</mark></strong> You don&#8217;t leave your family financially vulnerable. A major part of your life insurance safety net remains active.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Better Than Paid-Up:</mark></strong> Unlike making the policy paid-up, here you actually get cash in hand.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">A Clean Exit:</mark></strong> It severs your relationship with a product you don&#8217;t want, without the guilt of &#8220;wasting&#8221; the insurance you already paid for.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Risks of Selling Your ULIPs</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>No solution is perfect. Here&#8217;s what you should consider:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Won&#8217;t Get 100% Value:</mark></strong> The investor is buying your policy at a discount to its surrender value, allowing them to make a profit.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Not All Policies May Find Buyers:</mark></strong> Depending on the terms of your ULIP, remaining tenure, and market conditions, your policy may or may not find interested buyers quickly. Some policies might be more attractive to investors than others.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Platform Dependency:</mark></strong> You are relying on the platform&#8217;s due diligence and operational efficiency. While the payouts are handled by the insurance company, any platform-side hiccups could cause delays, especially in death claims.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">It&#8217;s a relatively new model:</mark></strong> As a new FinTech platform, it doesn&#8217;t fall under any specific regulator. IRDAI regulates the underlying insurance policy, and the assignment process is legal, but the platform itself operates in a newer, less-established space. Future regulatory changes could affect how these transactions work.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Taxes:</mark></strong> The tax implication of selling a policy is a bit of a grey area compared to standard surrender. If you surrender after 5 years, the proceeds are usually tax-free (if premium &lt; ₹2.5 Lakhs). If you sell, you are receiving money from a third party. While it mimics a surrender, you should consult a CA to ensure you don&#8217;t get hit with an unexpected tax demand.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>When Should You Think About Selling Your ULIP?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>So, should you sell, surrender, or discontinue? Let&#8217;s update our decision matrix.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you are still in the lock-in period (and have paid 1-4 premiums):</mark></strong> Selling/Assigning your policy via a platform like The Policy Exchange is likely your best option, assuming the discount on the surrender value is not too high. It helps you exit early with cash in hand while preserving a critical part of your life insurance. It&#8217;s far superior to discontinuing and waiting painfully for the lock-in to end.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If your policy has completed the lock-in period:</mark></strong> Surrendering the policy directly to the insurance company is probably better. At this stage, you can get the full fund value without any charges, and the amount is often tax-free. The hassle of selling might not be worth it since you can exit cleanly on your own.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>The journey of personal finance is about learning and adapting. Making a mistake by investing in a ULIP is not the end of the world. The key is to find the most efficient exit door.</p> <p>The emergence of platforms like The Policy Exchange has created a valuable new exit door for those trapped in the 5-year lock-in. It turns a stagnant, underperforming asset into liquid capital and salvages your life cover, a win-win that wasn&#8217;t easily available before.</p> <p>Before you make any decision, always read the fine print. Check the specific terms of your ULIP policy and understand the exact offer from any platform you use. But for the first time, if you&#8217;re stuck in a ULIP you regret, you have a powerful new tool to break free.</p> <p>Share these insights with your buddies.</p> <ul class="wp-block-social-links

There&#8217;s now a brand-new alternative that could be a game-changer, especially if you&#8217;re stuck in the dreaded 5-year lock-in period.</p> <p>You can now sell (assign) your ULIP policy to someone else.</p> <p>Sounds interesting?

Here we go!</strong></p> <p>Before we discuss this new option, let&#8217;s quickly recap what we had suggested regarding exiting ULIPs.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong>The Old ULIP Playbook: What We Knew Before</strong></strong></h2> <p>Three fundamental ways to exit a ULIP:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Discontinue during the lock-in period:</mark></strong> This is a painful option. You stop paying premiums, but your money gets locked in a &#8220;Discontinuance Fund&#8221; earning a measly ~3.5% interest after charges. You also pay a discontinuance fee and lose your life cover immediately. At the end of the 5-year lock-in, you might get back only 60-70% of what you paid. On top of that, there can be nasty tax implications, reversing your Section 80C benefits.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Surrender after the lock-in period:</mark></strong> This is cleaner. Once the mandatory 5 years are over, you can surrender the policy, get your fund&#8217;s value back with no charges, and the amount is tax-free if your annual premium was under ₹2.5 lakhs. The downside? You have to wait it out, leaving your money stuck in a sub-par product.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Convert to a Paid-up Policy:</mark></strong> We called this the &#8220;worst&#8221; option. After 5 years, you can stop paying premiums, but a reduced sum assured remains. Your money stays locked in the ULIP, and the insurer continues to charge you fees, eroding your potential returns.</li> </ol> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9a1d805a423c711a2e635754c670f1d8" style="font-size:1.2rem"><strong><strong><strong>Our earlier verdict on ULIP exist was simple:</strong></strong></strong></h3> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you&#8217;ve paid premiums for only 1-2 years:</mark> </strong>Bite the bullet and discontinue immediately. Take the financial hit, consider it a lesson fee, and redirect your future cash flows to a pure term insurance and a low-cost index fund.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you&#8217;ve paid premiums for 3 or 4 years:</mark> </strong>The tax hit from reversing 80C deductions is too significant. It&#8217;s often better to wait out the remaining lock-in period and then surrender the policy.</li> </ul> <p>Now, here&#8217;s the problem with our earlier recommendations.</p> <p>If you discontinued during the lock-in period, your money would be stuck earning a measly 3.5% until the lock-in ended. That&#8217;s worse than most savings accounts!</p> <p>And if you decided to wait till the lock-in ended, you&#8217;d have to keep paying premiums for a policy you didn&#8217;t even want. That&#8217;s like continuing to water a dead plant just because you can&#8217;t remove it from your balcony for 5 years.</p> <p>Not ideal, right?</p> <p>What if we told you there is a way to escape the lock-in, get your money now, and here is the kicker, keep your insurance cover active for free?</p> <p>Enter: The Policy Assignment.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>What Is Policy Assignment?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>In simple terms, assignment is the legal transfer of your policy&#8217;s ownership and benefits to another person or entity.</p> <p>A provision called Section 38 of the Insurance Act, 1938, allows a policyholder to transfer (or &#8220;assign&#8221;) their rights in an insurance policy to someone else.</p> <p>There are two main types:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Absolute Assignment:</mark></strong> This is a permanent transfer, usually for money. You are selling all your rights in the policy to the new owner. </li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Collateral Assignment:</mark></strong> This is a temporary transfer, often used as security for a loan (like taking a loan from a bank against your policy). Once the loan is repaid, the policy is transferred back to you.</li> </ol> <p>And recently, we came across a platform called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thepolicyexchange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Policy Exchange</strong></a>. They are essentially building a bridge between people who want to get rid of their policies (you) and investors who want stable returns.</p> <p>They facilitate Absolute Assignment, where you are selling the policy outright.</p> <p>Think of it like selling a second-hand car. You bought it, you don&#8217;t want it anymore, so you transfer the ownership papers to a buyer. The buyer pays you cash, and they take the car.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>How Does The Policy Exchange Platform Work?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Approach the Platform:</mark></strong> You tell The Policy Exchange that you wish to assign your ULIP policy.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">They Value Your Policy:</mark></strong> The platform calculates an approximate value for your policy. This is typically close to the &#8220;surrender value&#8221; you would get from the insurer, but since you&#8217;re selling it before the lock-in ends, it&#8217;s a discounted amount.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Your Policy is Listed:</mark></strong> The policy is listed on their platform for investors to browse. These investors are looking for assets that can give them returns in the 8-12% range.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">An Investor Buys It:</mark></strong> An investor agrees to buy your policy. They pay you the agreed-upon discounted surrender value amount upfront.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">The Transfer is Executed:</mark></strong> The policy is legally assigned to the investor. From this point on, they become the new owners. They are responsible for paying any future premiums (if applicable), and they are entitled to receive the maturity value when the policy matures.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Get Your Money &amp; Retain Partial Cover:</mark></strong> You walk away with a lump sum of cash immediately. And crucially, your life cover doesn&#8217;t completely vanish.</li> </ol> <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-d0f2a008fc5be13c0b2eb535a3c2fe28" style="font-size:1.2rem"><strong><strong><strong>Wait, How Do I Still Have Life Cover After Selling My Policy?</strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>This is the interesting part of this arrangement offered by The Policy Exchange. Let&#8217;s break it down with an example.</p> <p>Suppose you sell a policy with a Sum Assured (life cover) of ₹10 Lakhs to an investor for ₹2 Lakhs.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>The investor now owns the policy and is entitled to the maturity benefit.</li> <li>However, if, God forbid, you were to pass away before the policy matures or is surrendered, the insurance company pays out the ₹10 Lakh death claim.</li> <li>This ₹10 Lakh is not given entirely to the investor. The investor is legally entitled to get back their initial investment (₹2 Lakhs) plus the committed return (say, 10%). That comes to ₹2.2 Lakhs.</li> <li>The remaining amount (₹10 Lakhs &#8211; ₹2.2 Lakhs = ₹7.8 Lakhs) is paid to your family/nominee.</li> </ul> <p>So, by selling your ULIP policy, you:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Get immediate liquidity (discounted surrender value).</li> <li>Retain a significant portion of your life cover for your family, which you would have completely lost if you had simply discontinued the policy.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Benefits of Selling Your ULIPs</strong></strong></strong></h2> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Escape the Lock-in Period:</mark></strong> This is the biggest advantage. You don&#8217;t have to wait till the lock-in period ends to access your money. You get a lump sum upfront, which you can then use to buy a proper <a href="https://blog.vrid.in/2022/10/27/why-life-insurance-which-is-the-best-plan-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>term plan</strong></a> and invest in better avenues.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Avoid Financial Bleeding:</mark> </strong>Compared to discontinuing, you will likely get a better financial deal. Instead of your money rotting in a discontinuance fund for years, you get most of its current value in your hand now.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Retain Partial Life Cover:</mark></strong> You don&#8217;t leave your family financially vulnerable. A major part of your life insurance safety net remains active.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Better Than Paid-Up:</mark></strong> Unlike making the policy paid-up, here you actually get cash in hand.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">A Clean Exit:</mark></strong> It severs your relationship with a product you don&#8217;t want, without the guilt of &#8220;wasting&#8221; the insurance you already paid for.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Risks of Selling Your ULIPs</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>No solution is perfect. Here&#8217;s what you should consider:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">You Won&#8217;t Get 100% Value:</mark></strong> The investor is buying your policy at a discount to its surrender value, allowing them to make a profit.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Not All Policies May Find Buyers:</mark></strong> Depending on the terms of your ULIP, remaining tenure, and market conditions, your policy may or may not find interested buyers quickly. Some policies might be more attractive to investors than others.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Platform Dependency:</mark></strong> You are relying on the platform&#8217;s due diligence and operational efficiency. While the payouts are handled by the insurance company, any platform-side hiccups could cause delays, especially in death claims.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">It&#8217;s a relatively new model:</mark></strong> As a new FinTech platform, it doesn&#8217;t fall under any specific regulator. IRDAI regulates the underlying insurance policy, and the assignment process is legal, but the platform itself operates in a newer, less-established space. Future regulatory changes could affect how these transactions work.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">Taxes:</mark></strong> The tax implication of selling a policy is a bit of a grey area compared to standard surrender. If you surrender after 5 years, the proceeds are usually tax-free (if premium &lt; ₹2.5 Lakhs). If you sell, you are receiving money from a third party. While it mimics a surrender, you should consult a CA to ensure you don&#8217;t get hit with an unexpected tax demand.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>When Should You Think About Selling Your ULIP?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>So, should you sell, surrender, or discontinue? Let&#8217;s update our decision matrix.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If you are still in the lock-in period (and have paid 1-4 premiums):</mark></strong> Selling/Assigning your policy via a platform like The Policy Exchange is likely your best option, assuming the discount on the surrender value is not too high. It helps you exit early with cash in hand while preserving a critical part of your life insurance. It&#8217;s far superior to discontinuing and waiting painfully for the lock-in to end.</li> <li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9b51e0" class="has-inline-color">If your policy has completed the lock-in period:</mark></strong> Surrendering the policy directly to the insurance company is probably better. At this stage, you can get the full fund value without any charges, and the amount is often tax-free. The hassle of selling might not be worth it since you can exit cleanly on your own.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-vivid-purple-color has-text-color" style="font-size:1.3rem"><strong><strong><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>The journey of personal finance is about learning and adapting. Making a mistake by investing in a ULIP is not the end of the world. The key is to find the most efficient exit door.</p> <p>The emergence of platforms like The Policy Exchange has created a valuable new exit door for those trapped in the 5-year lock-in. It turns a stagnant, underperforming asset into liquid capital and salvages your life cover, a win-win that wasn&#8217;t easily available before.</p> <p>Before you make any decision, always read the fine print. Check the specific terms of your ULIP policy and understand the exact offer from any platform you use. But for the first time, if you&#8217;re stuck in a ULIP you regret, you have a powerful new tool to break free.</p> <p>Share these insights with your buddies.</p> <ul class="wp-block-social-links
